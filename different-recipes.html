      <h3>The science of Jollof rice</h3>
      <p>Jollof rice is a West African dish comprising of rice, 
      tomoatoes, and a stock base. It is consumed alll across Africa as a celebration food. Weddings, 
      birthdays, and celebrations of birth all across Africa all feature a plate of jollof. Paired with a hearty chicken leg and a side of salad,
      this meal has amazed and tantalized tounges for centuries. A simple dish, jollof is easy to make (and even easier to mess up). 
      Vivian's kitchen will provide a comphrehensive look and breakdown of the dish. If you wish to skip to the recipe, click the link below. </p>

      <h3>Components of Jollof rice</h3>
      <p>Jollof rice has 3 basic ingredients:</p>
      <!-- Using pre tag to keep format instead of p tag -->
      <pre>
        1. Tomatoes
        2. Rice
        3. Stock
      </pre>
      <p>In this recipe, you will learn how to make these three component of jollof</p>
      <!-- Tomato and cooking down the tomato paste -->
      <p class="title-text">1. Tomatoes</p>
      <p>The first step to making jollof rice is to cook down some Tomatoes. These don't necessarily 
      have to be tomatoes, Vivian herself recomends a blend of tomoatoes and tatashe - a less sweet variant of bell pepper. 
      First, cook down a small onion and some garlic until its translucent and fragrant. You'll know its ready when it starts smelling delicious&excl;
      Afterwards, the tomatoe blend can be addded. The main point of the base, however, is to cook it down. The tomatoe mix shou
      ld be thoroughly dry and removed of all water. Any water in the base makes the rice sour and tasti
      ng of raw tomatoe. </p>
      <p>Another important part is properly seasoning the base. Curry, thyme, buillion cubes, rosemary.
      Anthing in the cupboards will do. If the base has no salt, it'll be hard to introduce it once the rice has started.
      The base must be super seasoned.Meaning, it should taste too salty or sweet.
      Later, you will have to add water to it so it should be salty enough that diluting it will still give the rice flavour.</p>
      <!-- Information on rice, second point -->
      <p class="title-text">2. Rice</p>
      <p>After the tomatoes have been cooked down and water has been added, you must add rice to your 
      diluted base. You can use any basic rice you find in store, Vivian uses long-grain rice from superstore but any other can work in a pinch.
      The rice should be <span class="bold-text">washed</span>. 
      The amount of water added into the mixture should be about 2 or 3 cups, depending on how much 
      rice addded. Once the rice is added, you can add more water to make sure the water covers the rice with about half-a-finger of clearance on top.</p>
      <p>It should be cooked for 20 minutes on medium-high heat until the water in near done. When the water is almost finished, it should be switched 
      to medium-low heat until the water evaporates or the rice is soft. A little salt or pepper can be added now, to taste.</p>
      <!-- Explanation of stock -->
      <p class="title-text">3. the Stock</p>
      <p>This is the place with the most diveristy. Stock can be store-bought vegetarian or anything in the fridge. 
      On one notable occasion, vivian took a dollop of stew she'd already made to make a stock for the ric
      e. Traditionally its beef, or chicken. Whenever you make meat or boil chicken save the stock in your
      fridge for later. Inthis recipe, Vivian used pork stock from her thanksgiving dinner. In the absence of stock,
      crushed up buillion cubes mixed with water works just as well. Gravy packets will also work. All the
      stock does is add another layer of flavouring onto the food and makes it taste that much nicer.</p>

        <p>Leave pan covered for 10-15 minutes on medium-high heat until water is almost evaporated.
        Then, turn heat to medium low and constantly check water level and softness of rice until rice is of desired softness.</p>
